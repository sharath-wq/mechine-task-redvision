# Online Bookstore Application with MERN Stack

This repository features an online bookstore application built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). Users can browse, search, and view book details, while performing CRUD operations on the backend. The application includes authentication with JWT, error handling, and security measures. The frontend, developed with React and Vite, provides a user-friendly interface for book management and cart functionality, with roles for admin and user, allowing admins to manage books and view checkout lists, and users to add books to their cart and checkout.
